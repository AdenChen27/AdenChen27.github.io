# Hey, I'm Aden

I'm a second-year undergraduate student at UChicago studying Economics and Mathematics. The following are a few of my more interesting projects. Clicking on the project names leads you to their corresponding Github repository.

## LaTeX
My [LaTeX package](https://github.com/AdenChen27/latex) 
and Ultisnips [snippets file](https://github.com/AdenChen27/dotfiles/blob/main/vim/UltiSnips/tex.snippets) 
for taking math notes using LaTeX and vim.

Borrowed heavily from
[gillescastel](https://github.com/gillescastel)'s
[preamble file](https://github.com/gillescastel/lecture-notes/blob/master/algebraic-topology/preamble.tex)
for his
[lecture notes](https://github.com/gillescastel/lecture-notes), 
his [snippets file](https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets)
(see also his [blog post](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/)), 
and [Andrew Lin](https://web.stanford.edu/~lindrew/)'s
package, [lindrew](https://web.stanford.edu/~lindrew/lindrew.sty).




## [Guess the Operator](https://github.com/AdenChen27/GuessTheOperator)


Super nerdy game made during the 2024 UChicago Hackathon with [Hanlei Wen](https://github.com/hanleiwen), [Ziad Elshahawy](https://github.com/zelshahawy), [Justin Zhang](https://github.com/chenjiaz2022), and [Jack Hu](https://github.com/jackqchu). 

First-prize in web development category. 

Play it [here](https://adenchen27.github.io/GuessTheOperator/index.html). Have fun!



## [Ex Libris](https://github.com/uExLibris/uExLibris.github.io)

~~I have very recently started a popular science media with a few of my friends (20+!) named Ex Libris. (The name was appropriated from the name of a cafe located on the first floor of the Joseph Regenstein Library at the University of Chicago.)~~


The [website for Ex Libris](https://uexlibris.github.io/) is still in development and has only one demo article that I've written during the past winter break about [framing effect](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/framing-effect), [transaction utility theory](https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/6118/volumes/v10), [scarcity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity_(social_psychology)) etc.; the demo article was written in Chinese, but most, if not all, future articles will be in English.

2024.04: Project failed. Website might be recycled for personal blogging use.



## [English Reading Practice Website](https://github.com/AdenChen27/Project_0)

One common challenge in learning English as a second language (at a beginner to intermediate level) that I both experienced personally and observed among peers is the tendency to memorize translations of English words, making it difficult to understand their precise meanings in context due to nuances lost in translation. To address this issue, I tried to develop a new learning model where the learner is presented with new words, learns the new words, and immediately practices using them in context (instead of the common process of "reading -> finding new vocabulary -> learning new vocabulary( -> not seeing the words in the near future -> remembering only the translation, if not completely forgetting)").

[This website](https://adenchen27.pythonanywhere.com/index/) serves as an implementation of the proposed learning model. Users begin by selecting a passage, selecting and learning unfamiliar words within the passage (before being shown the full passage), and then immediately practicing using these newly learned words within the context of the passage via, for example, doing fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice questions about the newly learned words.

## [Online APA7 In-Text Citation Checker](https://github.com/AdenChen27/AdenChen27.github.io/tree/main/citation_checker)

During high school, I had to write several essays using APA7 format and was unaware of the existence of LaTeX. I'm familiar with various citation generator tools that assist in creating a reference list (one of which I particularly liked is [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/citation/generator/)), but I could not find any free online tools that can check my in-text citations. In particular, I need a tool that can: 

1. verity the format of my in-text citations (because some rules are kind of confusing for beginners), and
2. check whether my in-text citations match my reference list (i.e. whether each in-text citation has a matching entry in the reference list, and all entries in my reference list has been cited somewhere in the essay.)

So I created [one](https://adenchen27.github.io/citation_checker/main.html) using RegExp. It looks extremely primitive (because it is), but it gets the job done (mostly).

## [Econic](https://github.com/AdenChen27/MyMoneyOnMyMind)

Animations about behavioral economics concepts used in Econic, a Wechat Official Account blog publishing articles explaining behavioral economics to the general public.

## [Citation Network](https://github.com/AdenChen27/reference_map)

I tried to visualize the reference lists of some research papers I read as a graph (each node represents a research paper, each edge a citation). Here's a [demo](https://adenchen27.github.io/demo_0.html) of what I did. (Of course, this was before I know the existence of [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/), which does a much, much better job.)

## [Online function plotting](https://github.com/AdenChen27/AdenChen27.github.io/tree/main/func_image)

A [webpage](https://adenchen27.github.io/func_image/func_image.html) that plots function images.

## [2048 solver](https://github.com/AdenChen27/2048_solver)

Implemented using Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning.
