### [Online APA7 In-Text Citation Checker](https://github.com/AdenChen27/AdenChen27.github.io/tree/main/citation_checker)

<!-- There are loads of free online tools to generate a reference list (e.g. [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/citation/generator/apa/)), but what about your in-text citations? Well, try [this](https://adenchen27.github.io/citation_checker/main.html). ([*Github*](https://github.com/AdenChen27/AdenChen27.github.io/tree/main/citation_checker)) -->

During high school, I had to write several essays using APA7 format and was unaware of the existence of LaTeX. I'm familiar with various citation generator tools that assist in creating a reference list (one of which I particularly liked is [Scribbr](https://www.scribbr.com/citation/generator/)), but I could not find any free online tools that can check my in-text citations. In particular, I need a tool that can: 

1. verity the formatting of my in-text citations (because some rules are kind of confusing for beginners), and
2. check whether my in-text citations match my reference list (i.e. each in-text citation has a matching entry in my reference list, and all entries in my reference list has been cited in my essay.)

So I created [one](https://adenchen27.github.io/citation_checker/main.html) using RegExp. It looks extremely primitive (because it is), but it gets the job done (mostly).
